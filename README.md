# Potential energy surfaces repository

Repository of molecular potential energy surfaces by C. M. R. Rocha.

The FORTRAN code of the PES, test main program, compilation instructions and the original paper are all available inside each directory. 
They are separated by molecular species, the type of PES (DMBE, CHIPR, QFF, ...) and electronic state.
